# Networking Essentials

---

## 1. Introduction to Networking

- **Networking** refers to the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources and information.
- It allows for the exchange of data between devices, enabling communication over various types of media.
- Types of networks:
  - **LAN (Local Area Network)**
  - **WAN (Wide Area Network)**
  - **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**

---

## 2. Network Topologies

Network topology is the arrangement of network devices and their interconnections.

### Common Topologies:

- **Bus Topology**: Single central cable to which all devices are connected.
- **Star Topology**: Devices are connected to a central hub/switch.
- **Ring Topology**: Devices are connected in a circular fashion.
- **Mesh Topology**: Every device is connected to every other device.

## 3. OSI Model

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model defines 7 layers to standardize network functions.

| Layer       | Description                              |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Layer 7** | Application: End-user software interaction |
| **Layer 6** | Presentation: Data format translation   |
| **Layer 5** | Session: Establishment, management       |
| **Layer 4** | Transport: End-to-end communication      |
| **Layer 3** | Network: Routing and forwarding          |
| **Layer 2** | Data Link: Framing, MAC addresses        |
| **Layer 1** | Physical: Transmission of raw bits       |

## 4. IP Addressing

### IPv4 Addressing

- An **IPv4** address is a 32-bit address, usually written as four decimal numbers (octets) separated by dots, e.g., `192.168.1.1`.
- Classes of IPv4 addresses:
  - **Class A**: `1.0.0.0` to `127.255.255.255`
  - **Class B**: `128.0.0.0` to `191.255.255.255`
  - **Class C**: `192.0.0.0` to `223.255.255.255`
  
### IPv6 Addressing

- **IPv6** is a 128-bit address, written in hexadecimal format, e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.
- It was created to address the limited address space of IPv4.

## 5. Subnetting

- **Subnetting** is the process of dividing an IP network into smaller sub-networks.
- Example:
  - **IP Address**: `192.168.1.0/24`
  - **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.0`
  
Subnetting helps optimize address allocation and improve security.

---

## 6. Routing

Routing is the process of determining the path for data to travel from one network to another.

- **Router**: Device that forwards data between networks.
- **Static Routing**: Manually configured routes.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Routes are learned automatically by routing protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF, BGP).

---

## 7. TCP/IP Model

The **TCP/IP model** is the foundation of internet communications, often used instead of the OSI model.

| Layer       | Description                                |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Application** | End-user applications and protocols (HTTP, FTP) |
| **Transport**  | Provides end-to-end communication (TCP, UDP) |
| **Internet**   | Handles logical addressing and routing (IP) |
| **Network Access** | Deals with physical hardware and media (Ethernet) |

## 8. TCP vs UDP

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- **Connection-oriented**: Requires a connection before data transfer.
- **Reliable**: Ensures data is delivered in the correct order and retransmits lost packets.
- **Examples**: HTTP, FTP, SMTP

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- **Connectionless**: No connection setup required before sending data.
- **Unreliable**: Does not guarantee delivery or order.
- **Examples**: DNS, VoIP, streaming

---

## 9. DNS (Domain Name System)

- **DNS** translates human-readable domain names (e.g., `www.example.com`) into IP addresses.
- **DNS Resolution Process**: 
  1. Client queries local DNS resolver.
  2. Resolver queries authoritative DNS servers.
  3. IP address is returned to the client.

---

## 10. VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)

- **VLAN** allows multiple logical networks to exist on a single physical network.
- Segments traffic to improve security, performance, and management.

Example:

```plaintext
VLAN 10: HR
VLAN 20: Engineering
VLAN 30: Sales
```

---

## 11. Network Devices

### Common Network Devices:

- **Router**: Routes data between networks.
- **Switch**: Forwards data within a LAN, based on MAC addresses.
- **Hub**: A simple device that broadcasts data to all devices on a network (not very efficient).
- **Access Point (AP)**: Provides wireless access to the network.
- **Firewall**: Filters and controls incoming/outgoing network traffic.

---

## 12. Network Security

### Key Concepts:

- **Firewalls**: Control and filter incoming and outgoing network traffic.
- **Encryption**: Secures data during transmission (e.g., SSL/TLS).
- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of devices or users (e.g., WPA2 for Wi-Fi).
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: A secure, encrypted connection over a public network.

---

## 13. Wireless Networking

- **Wi-Fi**: Wireless networking standard (IEEE 802.11) for local area networks.
- **Wi-Fi Standards**: 
  - **802.11a/b/g/n/ac** (different speeds and frequencies)
- **WPA3**: Latest security standard for Wi-Fi.

---

## 14. Network Troubleshooting

Common tools:

- **ping**: Tests network connectivity.
- **traceroute**: Shows the path data takes across the network.
- **nslookup**: Queries DNS servers.
- **ipconfig/ifconfig**: Displays network configurations.
- **netstat**: Displays active connections and listening ports.
